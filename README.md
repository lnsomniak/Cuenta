# Cuenta

Grocery optimization that shows you both protein per-dollar and per-calorie so you can make your own call.

## Why

Most nutrition apps tell you what to do. Cuenta doesn't.

It calculates **g/$** (protein per dollar) and **g/cal** (protein per 100 calories) for every item, then lets you decide what matters today. Sometimes you're optimizing for budget. Sometimes you're cutting. The tradeoffs are yours.

> *options, not decisions*
